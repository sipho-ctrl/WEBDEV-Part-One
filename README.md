# Adnil Kota Hub Website - HTML Foundation

## Project Overview
**WEBDEV-PART-ONE**  
This repository contains the HTML foundation for the official website of Adnil Kota Hub, a fast-food restaurant specializing in authentic South African kotas located in Bloemfontein CBD. This project represents Part 1 of a web development assignment focusing on semantic HTML5 structure.

## Business Context
Adnil Kota Hub operates from Louis Building, 80 Oliver Tambo Road, Bloemfontein. While maintaining a social media presence on Facebook and Instagram, the business lacked a professional website to centralize information, build credibility, and serve growing customer demand. This website solves that problem by providing a digital storefront showcasing their menu, location, and business information.
